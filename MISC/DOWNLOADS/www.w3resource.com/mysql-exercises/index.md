## What is MySQL?

MySQL is the world's most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), enabling the cost-effective delivery of reliable, high-performance and scalable Web-based and embedded database applications. It is widely-used as the database component of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python) web application software stack.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [SQL](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/tutorials.php) and [MySQL](https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/mysql-tutorials.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your MySQL query skills. Currently following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
