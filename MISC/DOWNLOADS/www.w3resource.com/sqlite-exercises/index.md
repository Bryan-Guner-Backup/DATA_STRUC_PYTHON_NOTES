## What is SQLite?

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section with an online editor for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [SQL](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/tutorials.php) and [SQLite](https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your SQLite query skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
