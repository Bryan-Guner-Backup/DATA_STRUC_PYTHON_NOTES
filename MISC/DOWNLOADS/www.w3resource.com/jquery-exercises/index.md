## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery etc. Hope, these exercises help you to improve your JQuery coding skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
