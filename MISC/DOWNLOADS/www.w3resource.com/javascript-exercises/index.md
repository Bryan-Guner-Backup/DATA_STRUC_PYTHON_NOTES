## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment ( a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [JavaScript](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/javascript.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your JavaScript coding skills. Currently following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!

**More to Come !**

Note : Since JavaScript is a loosely-typed, dynamic and expressive language, you may accomplish the same task in various ways. Therefore the ways (solution of the exercises) described here are not the only ways to do stuff. Rather, it would be great, if this helps you anyway to choose your own methods.

## JavaScript: Tips of the Day

**keys**

    const obj = { a: 'one', b: 'two', a: 'three' };
    console.log(obj);

If you have two keys with the same name, the key will be replaced. It will still be in its first position, but with the last specified value.
