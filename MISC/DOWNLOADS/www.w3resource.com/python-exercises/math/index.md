## Python Math \[88 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

**1.** Write a Python program to convert degree to radian. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note : The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius).  
_Test Data:_  
Degree : 15  
Expected Result in radians: 0.2619047619047619  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to convert radian to degree. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
_Test Data:_  
Radian : .52  
Expected Result : 29.781818181818185  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to calculate the area of a trapezoid. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note : A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two sides parallel. The trapezoid is equivalent to the British definition of the trapezium. An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid in which the base angles are equal so.  
_Test Data:_  
Height : 5  
Base, first value : 5  
Base, second value : 6  
Expected Output: Area is : 27.5  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-3.php)

**4.** Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note : A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal). A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.  
_Test Data:_  
Length of base : 5  
Height of parallelogram : 6  
Expected Output: Area is : 30.0

**5.** Write a Python program to calculate surface volume and area of a cylinder. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes, the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.  
_Test Data:_  
volume : Height (4), Radius(6)  
Expected Output:  
Volume is : 452.57142857142856  
Surface Area is : 377.1428571428571  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-5.php)

**6.** Write a Python program to calculate surface volume and area of a sphere. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: A sphere is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball.  
_Test Data:_  
Radius of sphere : .75  
Expected Output :  
Surface Area is : 7.071428571428571  
Volume is : 1.7678571428571428  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-6.php)

**7.** Write a Python program to calculate arc length of an angle. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: In a planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane.  
_Test Data:_  
Diameter of a circle : 8  
Angle measure : 45  
Expected Output :  
Arc Length is : 3.142857142857143  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-7.php)

**8.** Write a Python program to calculate the area of the sector. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: A circular sector or circle sector, is the portion of a disk enclosed by two radii and an arc, where the smaller area is known as the minor sector and the larger being the major sector.  
_Test Data:_  
Radius of a circle : 4  
Angle measure : 45  
Expected Output:  
Sector Area: 6.285714285714286

_Test Data:_  
The x value : 4  
The y value : 0  
The z value : -4  
Expected Output:

If sum_difference(12)  
Expected Output :  
5434  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-11.php)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-12.php)

**13.** Write a Python program to find out, if the given number is abundant. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: In number theory, an abundant number or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16.  
_Test Data:_  
If is_abundant(12)  
If is_abundant(13)  
Expected Output:  
True  
False  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-13.php)

**14.** Write a Python program to sum all amicable numbers from 1 to specified numbers. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.)  
_Test Data:_  
If amicable_numbers_sum(9999)  
If amicable_numbers_sum(999)  
If amicable_numbers_sum(99)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-16.php)

**17.** Write a Python program to print the first n Lucky Numbers. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Lucky numbers are defined via a sieve as follows.  
Begin with a list of integers starting with 1 :  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, . . . .  
Now eliminate every second number :  
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, ...  
The second remaining number is 3, so remove every 3rd number:  
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, ...  
The next remaining number is 7, so remove every 7th number:  
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, ...  
Next, remove every 9th number and so on.  
Finally, the resulting sequence is the lucky numbers.

**18.** Write a Python program to computing square roots using the Babylonian method. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Perhaps the first algorithm used for approximating âˆšS is known as the Babylonian method, named after the Babylonians, or "Hero's method", named after the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method. It can be derived from (but predates by 16 centuries) Newton's method. The basic idea is that if x is an overestimate to the square root of a non-negative real number S then S / x will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers may reasonably be expected to provide a better approximation.

**19.** Write a Python program to multiply two integers without using the \* operator in python. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-math-exercise-19.php)

**20.** Write a Python program to calculate magic square. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers (i.e., each number is used once), usually integers, in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the main and secondary diagonals, all add up to the same number, called the "magic constant." A magic square has the same number of rows as it has columns, and in conventional math notation, "n" stands for the number of rows (and columns) it has. Thus, a magic square always contains n2 numbers, and its size (the number of rows \[and columns\] it has) is described as being "of order n".

**21.** Write a Python program to print all primes (Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) smaller than or equal to a specified number. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes, one of a number of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2.
