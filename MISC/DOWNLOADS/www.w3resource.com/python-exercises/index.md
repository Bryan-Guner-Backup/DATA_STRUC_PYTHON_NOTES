## What is Python language?

Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with Python.

Hope, these exercises help you to improve your Python coding skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises .... Happy Coding!

Note : Download Python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2/ and install in your system to execute the Python programs. You can read our [Python Installation](https://www.w3resource.com/python/install-python-on-linux-and-windows.php) on Fedora Linux and Windows 7, if you are unfamiliar to Python installation.  
You may accomplish the same task (solution of the exercises) in various ways, therefore the ways described here are not the only ways to do stuff. Rather, it would be great, if this helps you anyway to choose your own methods.

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
