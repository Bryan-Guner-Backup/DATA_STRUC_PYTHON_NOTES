## Python Enum: \[ 5 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

**1.** Write a Python program to create an Enum object and display a member name and value. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
_Sample data :_  
Member name: Albania  
Member value: 355  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-enum-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to iterate over an enum class and display individual member and their value. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Expected Output:  
Afghanistan = 93  
Albania = 355  
Algeria = 213  
Andorra = 376  
Angola = 244  
Antarctica = 672

**3.** Write a Python program to display all the member name of an enum class ordered by their values. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Expected Output:  
Country Name ordered by Country Code:  
Afghanistan  
Algeria  
Angola  
Albania  
Andorra  
Antarctica

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
