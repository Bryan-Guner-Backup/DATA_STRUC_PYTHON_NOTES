## Python Itertools \[44 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Python itertools module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python. The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination.

**1.** Write a Python program to create an iterator from several iterables in a sequence and display the type and elements of the new iterator. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

**3.** Write a Python program to generate the running maximum, minimum value of the elements of an iterable. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
