## Python built-in Modules \[31 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Python comes with a library of standard modules. Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.

Following exercises based on important methods of useful Python built in modules.

**Module - random**

**1.** Write a Python program to generate a random color hex, a random alphabetical string, random value between two integers (inclusive) and a random multiple of 7 between 0 and 70. Use random.randint()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-module-random-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to select a random element from a list, set, dictionary (value) and a file from a directory. Use random.choice()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-module-random-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to generate a random alphabetical character, alphabetical string and alphabetical string of a fixed length. Use random.choice()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

**4.** Write a Python program to construct a seeded random number generator, also generate a float between 0 and 1, excluding 1. Use random.random()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-module-random-exercise-4.php)

**5.** Write a Python program to generate a random integer between 0 and 6 - excluding 6, random integer between 5 and 10 - excluding 10, random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3 and random date between two dates. Use random.randrange()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

**8.** Write a Python program to create a list of random integers and randomly select multiple items from the said list. Use random.sample()  
[Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-module-random-exercise-8.php)

**9.** Write a Python program to set a random seed and get a random number between 0 and 1. Use random.random. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
