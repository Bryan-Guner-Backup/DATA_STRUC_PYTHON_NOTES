## Binary Search Tree: \[ 6 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

**1.** Write a Python program to create a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array (given) elements where array elements are sorted in ascending order. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-binary-search-tree-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to find the closest value of a given target value in a given non-empty Binary Search Tree (BST) of unique values. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-binary-search-tree-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to check whether a given a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

Let a binary search tree (BST) is defined as follows:  
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.  
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

    Example 1:
        2
       / \
      1   3
    Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
    Example 2:
        1
       / \
      2   3
    Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.

**4.** Write a Python program to delete a node with the given key in a given Binary search tree (BST). [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: Search for a node to remove. If the node is found, delete the node.

**5.** Write a Python program to convert a given array elements to a height balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-binary-search-tree-exercise-5.php)

**6.** Write a Python program to find the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element in a given a binary search tree. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
