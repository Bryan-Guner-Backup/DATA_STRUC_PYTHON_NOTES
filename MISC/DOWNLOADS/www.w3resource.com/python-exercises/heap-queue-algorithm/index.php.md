## Python heap queue algorithm \[29 exercises with solution \]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children.  
Here are some exercises of heap queue algorithm.

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
