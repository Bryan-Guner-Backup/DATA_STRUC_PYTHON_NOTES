## Python conditional statements and loops \[44 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

**1.** Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-conditional-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
\[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 \[ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit \]  
_Expected Output_ :  
60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit  
45°F is 7 in Celsius  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-conditional-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
