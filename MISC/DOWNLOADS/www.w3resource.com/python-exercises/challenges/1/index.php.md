**23.** Write a Python program where you take any positive integer n, if n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process until you reach 1. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Input : 12  
Output : \[12, 6.0, 3.0, 10.0, 5.0, 16.0, 8.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0\]  
According to Wikipedia, the Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture.  
The conjecture can be summarized as follows. Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One") indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.  
Example :  
For instance, starting with n = 12, one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.  
n = 19, for example, takes longer to reach 1: 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Input : 7  
Output : 0  
Hamming numbers are numbers of the form  
H = 2<sup>i</sup> x 3<sup>j</sup> x 5<sup>k</sup>  
Where i, j, k = 0  
The sequence of Hamming numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27. . . consists of all numbers of the form 2i.3j.5k where i, j and k are non-negative integers.

**42.** Write a Python program to find the starting number, under ten thousand will create the longest chain. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
From Wikipedia - The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

**46.** Write a Python program to compute the sum of all the amicable numbers under a given number. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
From Wikipedia - Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.)  
The smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284). They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

**47.** Write a Python program to find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
In number theory, an abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.  
Example:  
The first few abundant numbers are:  
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 102, ...  
The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for a total of 16.  
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

**48.** Write a Python program to find the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
In mathematics, permutation is the act of arranging the members of a set into a sequence or order, or, if the set is already ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements?a process called permuting. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are: 012 021 102 120 201 210

**49.** Write a Python program to find the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 500 digits. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F<sub>n</sub> form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1  
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:  
F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n</sub>-1 + F<sub>n</sub>-2, where F<sub>1</sub> = 1 and F<sub>2</sub> = 1.  
Hence the first 12 terms will be:  
F<sub>1</sub> = 1  
F<sub>2</sub> = 1  
F<sub>3</sub> = 2  
F<sub>4</sub> = 3  
F<sub>5</sub> = 5  
F<sub>6</sub> = 8  
F<sub>7</sub> = 13  
F<sub>8</sub> = 21  
F<sub>9</sub> = 34  
F<sub>10</sub> = 55  
F<sub>11</sub> = 89  
F<sub>12</sub> = 144  
The 12<sup>th</sup> term, F<sub>12</sub>, is the first term to contain three digits.

**52.** From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  
In computational linguistics and computer science, edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.  
This problem was asked by Google.  
The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other. For example, the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is three: substitute the "k" for "s", substitute the "e" for "i", and append a "g".  
Write a Python program to compute the edit distance between two given strings. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

**55.** Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport.  
Write a Python program to compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
For example, given the list of flights \[('SFO', 'HKO'), ('YYZ', 'SFO'),  
('YUL', 'YYZ'), ('HKO', 'ORD')\] and starting airport 'YUL', you should return the list \['YUL', 'YYZ', 'SFO', 'HKO', 'ORD'\].  
Given the list of flights \[('SFO', 'COM'), ('COM', 'YYZ')\] and starting airport 'COM', you should return null.  
Given the list of flights \[('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'A')\]  
and starting airport 'A', you should return the list \['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'\]  
even though \['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'\] is also a valid itinerary. However, the first one is lexicographically smaller.  
Sample Output:  
\['YUL', 'YYZ', 'SFO', 'HKO', 'ORD'\]  
not valid intinerary  
\['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'\]
