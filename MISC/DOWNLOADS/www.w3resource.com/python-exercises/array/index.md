## Python Array \[24 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Python array module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.

**1.** Write a Python program to create an array of 5 integers and display the array items. Access individual element through indexes. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Sample Output:  
1  
3  
5  
7  
9  
Access first three items individually  
1  
3  
5

**2.** Write a Python program to append a new item to the end of the array. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Sample Output:  
Original array: array('i', \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9\])  
Append 11 at the end of the array:  
New array: array('i', \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\])  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-array-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to reverse the order of the items in the array. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Sample Output  
Original array: array('i', \[1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 1, 9, 3\])  
Reverse the order of the items:  
array('i', \[3, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5, 3, 1\])

**4.** Write a Python program to get the length in bytes of one array item in the internal representation. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Sample Output:  
Original array: array('i', \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9\])  
Length in bytes of one array item: 4  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-array-exercise-4.php)

**5.** Write a Python program to get the current memory address and the length in elements of the buffer used to hold an array's contents and also find the size of the memory buffer in bytes. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Sample Output:  
Original array: array('i', \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9\])  
Current memory address and the length in elements of the buffer: (139741883429512, 5)  
The size of the memory buffer in bytes: 20  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-array-exercise-5.php)

**6.** Write a Python program to get the number of occurrences of a specified element in an array. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
