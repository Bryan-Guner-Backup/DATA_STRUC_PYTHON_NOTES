## Python Requests \[9 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic.

**1.** Write a Python code to find the Requests module - version, licence, copyright information, author, author email, document url, title and description. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python code to check the status code issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. Print all of the methods and attributes available to objects on successful request. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the response text and content. Also get the raw socket response from the server. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-3.php)

**4.** Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the information of headers. Also parse these values and print key-value pairs holding various information. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-4.php)

**5.** Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the JSON value of the response. Also print each key value of the response. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-5.php)

**6.** Write a Python code to send a request to a web page and stop waiting for a response after a given number of seconds. In the event of times out of request, raise Timeout exception. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-6.php)

**7.** Write a Python code to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-7.php)

**8.** Write a Python code to send cookies to a given server and access cookies from the response of a server. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
[Click me to see the sample solution](python-request-exercise-8.php)

**9.** Write a Python code to verify the SSL certificate for a website which is certified. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
