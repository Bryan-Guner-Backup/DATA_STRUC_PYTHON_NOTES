A bigram or digram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words. A bigram is an n-gram for n=2. The frequency distribution of every bigram in a string is commonly used for simple statistical analysis of text in many applications, including in computational linguistics, cryptography, speech recognition, and so on.  
Original list:  
\['Sum all the items in a list', 'Find the second smallest number in a list'\]  
Bigram sequence of the said list:  
\[('Sum', 'all'), ('all', 'the'), ('the', 'items'), ('items', 'in'), ('in', 'a'), ('a', 'list'), ('Find', 'the'), ('the', 'second'), ('second', 'smallest'), ('smallest', 'number'), ('number', 'in'), ('in', 'a'), ('a', 'list')\]

## List: Cheat Sheet

**Making a list:**

    colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White']

**Accessing elements:**

    # Getting the first element
    first_col = colors[0]
    # Getting the second element
    second_col = colors[1]
    # Getting the last element
    newest_col = colors[-1]

**Modifying individual items:**

    # Changing an element
    colors[0] = 'Yellow'
    colors[-2] = 'Red'

**Adding elements:**

    # Adding an element to the end of the list
    colors.append('Orange')
    # Starting with an empty list
    colors = []
    colors.append('Red')
    colors.append('Blue')
    colors.append('Green')
    # Inserting elements at a particular position
    colors.insert(0, 'Violet')
    colors.insert(2, 'Purple')

**Removing elements:**

    # Deleting an element by its position
    del colors[-1]
    # Removing an item by its value
    colors.remove('Green')

**Popping elements:**

    # Pop the last item from a list
    most_recent_col = colors.pop()
    print(most_recent_col)
    # Pop the first item in a list
    first_col = colors.pop(0)
    print(first_col)

**List length:**

    # Find the length of a list
    num_colors = len(colors)
    print("We have " + str(num_colors) + " colors.")

**Sorting a list:**

    # Sorting a list permanently
    colors.sort()
    # Sorting a list permanently in reverse alphabetical order
    colors.sort(reverse=True)
    # Sorting a list temporarily
    print(sorted(colors))
    print(sorted(colors, reverse=True))
    # Reversing the order of a list
    colors.reverse()

**Looping through a list:**

    # Printing all items in a list
    for col in colors:
     print(col)
    # Printing a message for each item, and a separate message afterwards
    for col in colors:
     print("Welcome, " + col + "!")
    print("Welcome, we're glad to see you all!")

**The range() function:**

    # Printing the numbers 0 to 2000
    for num in range(2001):
     print(num)
    # Printing the numbers 1 to 2000
    for num in range(1, 2001):
     print(num)
    # Making a list of numbers from 1 to a million
    nums = list(range(1, 1000001))

**Simple statistics:**

    # Finding the minimum value in a list
    nums = [23, 22, 44, 17, 77, 55, 1, 65, 82, 2]
    num_min = min(nums)
    # Finding the maximum value
    nums = [23, 22, 44, 17, 77, 55, 1, 65, 82, 2]
    num_max = max(nums)
    # Finding the sum of all numbers
    nums = [23, 22, 44, 17, 77, 55, 1, 65, 82, 2]
    total_num = sum(nums)

**Slicing a list:**

    # Getting the first three items
    colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White']
    first_three = colors [:3]
    # Getting the middle three items
    middle_three = colors[1:4]
    # Getting the last three items
    last_three = colors[-3:]

**Copying a list:**

    # Making a copy of a list
    colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White']
    copy_of_colors = colors[:]

**List of Comprehensions:**

    # Using a loop to generate a list of square numbers
    squr = []
    for x in range(1, 11):
     sq = x**2
     squr.append(sq)
    # Using a comprehension to generate a list of square numbers
    squr = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
    # Using a loop to convert a list of names to upper case
    colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White']
    upper_cols = []
    for cols in colors:
     upper_cols.append(cols.upper())
    # Using a comprehension to convert a list of names to upper case
    colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Black', 'White']
    upper_cols = [cols.upper() for cols in colors]
