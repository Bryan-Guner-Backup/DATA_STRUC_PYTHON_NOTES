## Pandas Pivot Table \[13 exercises with solution\]

\[ The purpose of the following exercises to show various tasks of a pivot table. We have executed Python code in Jupyter QtConsole and used [Salesdata.xlsx](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/excel/SaleData.xlsx) as reference data. To get Jupyter QtConsole download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

A pivot table is a table of statistics that summarizes the data of a more extensive table (such as from a database, spreadsheet, or business intelligence program). This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together in a meaningful way.

**1.** Write a Pandas program to create a Pivot table with multiple indexes from a given excel sheet (Salesdata.xlsx). [Go to Excel data](#saledata)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
