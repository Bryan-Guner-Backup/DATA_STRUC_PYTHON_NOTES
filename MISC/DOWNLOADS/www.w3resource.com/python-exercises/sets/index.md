## Python Sets \[ 20 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.  
Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.

**1.** Write a Python program to create a set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-1.php)

**2.** Write a Python program to iteration over sets. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-2.php)

**3.** Write a Python program to add member(s) in a set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-3.php)

**4.** Write a Python program to remove item(s) from a given set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-4.php)

**5.** Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-5.php)

**6.** Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-6.php)

**7.** Write a Python program to create a union of sets. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-7.php)

**8.** Write a Python program to create set difference. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-8.php)

**9.** Write a Python program to create a symmetric difference. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-9.php)

**10.** Write a Python program to check if a set is a subset of another set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-10.php)

**11.** Write a Python program to create a shallow copy of sets. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

Note : Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object.

**12.** Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-12.php)

**13.** Write a Python program to use of frozensets. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
Note: Frozensets behave just like sets except they are immutable.

**17.** Write a Python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-17.php)

**18.** Write a Python program to check if a given set is superset of itself and superset of another given set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-18.php)

**19.** Write a Python program to find the elements in a given set that are not in another set. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

[Click me to see the sample solution](python-sets-exercise-19.php)

## Python: Tips of the Day

**Join Strings in an Iterable:**

    >>> words = ('Hello', 'Python', 'Programmers')
    >>> '!'.join(words)
    'Hello!Python!Programmers'
    >>> words_dict = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
    >>> '&'.join(words_dict.values())
    'zero&one&two&three'
