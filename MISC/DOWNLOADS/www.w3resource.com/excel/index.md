## Introduction

Excel is an extremely powerful tool for manipulating a very large amount of data. It is really works well for any type of day to day simple calculations and tracking almost any kind of information. The unique future of excel is the grid of cells. Cells can contain numbers, text or formulas. You put data in your cells and group them in rows and columns. That allows you to add up your data, sort and filter it, put it in tables, and build great-looking charts. Let’s learn the basic steps to get you started.

## Create a new workbook

Excel documents are called workbooks. Each workbook contains one or more sheets, typically called spreadsheets. You can add as many sheets as you want to a workbook, or you can create new workbooks to keep your data separate.

When you start excel first time (see the following picture) you can open existing workbook over here or start with a template. Since this is your first time click on the Blank workbook.

The area down here is where you create your worksheet.

![blank workbook](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/blank-workbook.png)

## Input your data

- Click an empty cell. For example, cell B2 on the below sheet.
- Type text or a number in the cell.
- Press Enter or Tab to move to the next cell.

Note : Cells are referenced by their location in the row and column on the sheet.

In the following workbook address of 1 is cell B2, 2 is cell B3, and 3 is cell B4.

## Create a simple formula

Adding numbers is just one of the things you can do, but Excel can do other arithmetical formulas too. Here are some simple formulas to add, subtract, multiply or divide your numbers.

- Move the mouse in a cell and type an equal sign (=). That tells Excel that this cell will contain a formula.
- Type a combination of numbers and calculation operators, like the plus sign (+) for addition, the minus sign (-) for subtraction, the asterisk (\*) for multiplication, or the forward slash (/) for the division.

  For example =(6+6\*2)/3

  ![formulabar](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/formulabar.png)

- To execute the above formula Press Enter.

Note : To stay on the active cell Press Ctrl+Enter.

## Apply a number format

To distinguish between different types of numbers, add a format, like currency, percentages, or dates.

- Select the cells that have numbers you want to format.
- Click Home tab --&gt; General.
- Pick a number format

## Add your data use AutoSum

When you've entered numbers in your sheet, you can add them up to use a fast way that is AutoSum.

AutoSum adds up the numbers and shows the result in the cell you selected.
