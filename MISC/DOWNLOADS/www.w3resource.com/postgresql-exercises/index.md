## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [SQL](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/tutorials.php) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/tutorial.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your PostgreSQL query skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
