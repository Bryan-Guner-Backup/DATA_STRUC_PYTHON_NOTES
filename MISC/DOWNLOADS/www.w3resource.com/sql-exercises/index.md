## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is an ANSI standard computer language for accessing and manipulating database systems. It is used for managing data in relational database management system which stores data in the form of tables and relationship between data is also stored in the form of tables. SQL statements are used to retrieve and update data in a database.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [SQL](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/tutorials.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your SQL skills. Currently following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
