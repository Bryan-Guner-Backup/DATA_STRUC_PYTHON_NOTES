## Learn Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") in Japan. Ruby development began in February 1993 and the first alpha version of Ruby was released in December 1994. Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp, it borrows heavily from Perl and the class library is essentially an object-oriented reorganization of Perl's functionality. The main website of the Ruby programming language is ruby-lang.org
