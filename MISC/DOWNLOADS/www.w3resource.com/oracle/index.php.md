## Introduction

Oracle is a trademark of Oracle Corporation and in common usage, refers to the database ( a relational database with added object-oriented features) engine and a range of front-end products. Oracle database products deliver innovative technologies and leading price/performance, from the enterprise to small workgroups, from the cloud to mobile devices, from super-clusters to single servers.  
Over the past few decades, Oracle grew from being one of many vendors that developed database product to being widely recognized as the database market leader. In every database release, Oracle has improved the scalability, functionality, and manageability of the database.

**History:**

- 1977: Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates founded Software Development Laboratories.
- 1978: Oracle Version 1, written in assembly language, runs on PDP-11 under RSX, in 128K of memory.
- 1979: Software Development Laboratories changed its company-name to "Relational Software, Inc." (RSI) and introduced its product Oracle V2 as an early relational database system.
- 1982: RSI in its turn changed its name, becoming known as "Oracle Corporation".
- 1983: The company released Oracle version 3.
- 1984: Oracle Corporation released Oracle version 4, which supported read-consistency.

**Oracle Database Architecture**

An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. The database has logical structures and physical structures. Because the physical and logical structures are separate, the physical storage of data can be managed without affecting the access to logical storage structures. Here are some important information on Oracle databases architecture :

- Grid Architecture : The grid style of computing aims to solve some common problems with enterprise IT: the problem of application silos that lead to under utilized, dedicated hardware resources, the problem of monolithic, unwieldy systems that are expensive to maintain and difficult to change, and the problem of fragmented and disintegrated information that cannot be fully exploited by the enterprise as a whole.
- Application Architecture : There are two common ways to architect a database: client/server or multitier. As internet computing becomes more prevalent in computing environments, many database management systems are moving to a multitier environment.
- Physical Database Structures : Every Oracle database has one or more physical datafiles (contain all the database data). The data of logical database structures, such as tables and indexes, is physically stored in the datafiles allocated for a database. The characteristics of datafiles are :
  - A datafile can be associated with only one database.
  - Datafiles can have certain characteristics set to let them automatically extend when the database runs out of space.
  - One or more datafiles form a logical unit of database storage called a tablespace.
- Logical Database Structures : The logical storage structures, including data blocks, extents, and segments, enable Oracle to have fine-grained control of disk space use.
- Schemas and Common Schema Objects : A schema is a collection of database objects and is owned by a database user and has the same name as that user. Schema objects are the logical structures that directly refer to the database's data. It includes structures like tables, views, and indexes.
- Oracle Data Dictionary : Each Oracle database has a data dictionary and the data dictionary is a set of tables and views that are used as a read-only reference about the database. For example, a data dictionary stores information about both the logical and physical structure of the database.
- Oracle Instance : Every time a Oracle database is started, a system global area (SGA) is allocated and Oracle background processes are started. The combination of the background processes and memory buffers is called an Oracle instance.
- Accessing the Database : Oracle Net Services is Oracle's mechanism for interfacing with the communication protocols used by the networks that facilitate distributed processing and distributed databases.
- Oracle Utilities : Oracle provides several utilities for data transfer, data maintenance, and database administration, including Data Pump Export and Import, SQL\*Loader, and LogMiner.

**Oracle Database Features**

- Scalability and Performance

**Oracle Database Application Development**

SQL and PL/SQL form the core of Oracle's application development stack. Most enterprise and web applications access databases using SQL. Enterprise Applications generate XML from SQL queries, and content-repositories are built on top of SQL tables. It is a simple, widely understood, unified data model and also used in many standalone applications. It is invoked directly from Java (JDBC), Oracle Call Interface (OCI), Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI), or XSU (XML SQL Utility). Stored packages, procedures, and triggers can all be written in PL/SQL or in Java.
