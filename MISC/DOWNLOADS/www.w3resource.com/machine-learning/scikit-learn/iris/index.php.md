## Python Machine learning Iris flower data set \[38 exercises with solution\]

\[_An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts._\]

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with Python, Scikit-learn. Hope, these exercises help you to improve your Machine learning skills using Scikit-learn. Currently, data set are available, we are working hard to add more exercises .... Happy Coding!

**Iris flower data set**

From Wikipedia - The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the GaspÃ© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"

![iris flower data set](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/iris_flower_dataset.png)

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

**4.** Write a Python program to create a 2-D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Now convert the NumPy array to a SciPy sparse matrix in CSR format. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)  
From wikipedia :  
In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. By contrast, if most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m x n for an m x n matrix) is called the sparsity of the matrix (which is equal to 1 minus the density of the matrix). Using those definitions, a matrix will be sparse when its sparsity is greater than 0.5.

**19.** From Wikipedia -  
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)

## K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in Iris flower data set \[8 exercises with solution\]

From Wikipedia,

In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.\[1\] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

- itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPageElement/Heading"&gt; In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
- itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPageElement/Heading"&gt; In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.

![K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in Iris flower data set](https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm.svg)

Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).

**1.** Write a Python program to split the iris dataset into its attributes (X) and labels (y). The X variable contains the first four columns (i.e. attributes) and y contains the labels of the dataset. [Go to the editor](#EDITOR)
