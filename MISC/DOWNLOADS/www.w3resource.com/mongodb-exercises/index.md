## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB avoids the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [NoSQL](https://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/nosql.php) and [MongoDB](https://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/nosql.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your MongoDB query skills. Currently, following exercises are available based on '**_restaurants'_** collection, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
