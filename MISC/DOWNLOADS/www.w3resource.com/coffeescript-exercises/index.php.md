Note : Since JavaScript is a loosely-typed, dynamic and expressive language, you may accomplish the same task in various ways. Therefore the ways (solution of the exercises) described here are not the only ways to do stuff. Rather, it would be great, if this helps you anyway to choose your own methods.
