## What is Oracle database?

An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. In general, a server reliably manages a large amount of data in a multiuser environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data. All this is accomplished while delivering high performance. A database server also prevents unauthorized access and provides efficient solutions for failure recovery.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with [SQL](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/tutorials.php) and [Oracle](https://www.w3resource.com/oracle/index.php). Hope, these exercises help you to improve your Oracle query skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Happy Coding!
